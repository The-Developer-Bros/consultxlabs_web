/**
 * Netlify scheduled ticker — ADR 27 (docs/enterprise/70-design-decisions/27-state-as-outbox-and-scheduled-ticker.md).
 *
 * ADR 22 measured GitHub Actions delivering a sub-hourly `cron:` schedule
 * roughly once every hundred minutes (#866), so the fleet's money sweeps were
 * running six times slower than their declared cadence. This function POSTs
 * the ten latency-sensitive `/api/cleanup/*` routes every five minutes
 * instead of waiting on Actions. It never writes money state itself: every
 * target is `CRON_SECRET`-gated and wraps its core in `withCronLock`, so a
 * tick that overlaps a GitHub Actions run (or another tick) answers 409 from
 * the loser — expected, not an error — and Actions stays as the unbounded
 * daily/weekly scheduler and backstop (#1356).
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free: no `@netlify/functions` import, only
 * `process.env` and the global `fetch`/`AbortController` the Netlify
 * Functions runtime already provides.
