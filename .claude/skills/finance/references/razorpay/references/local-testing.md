# Local Razorpay Testing Guide

Complete guide to testing your Razorpay integration locally before touching production.

## Step 1: Get Test API Keys

1. Go to [Razorpay Dashboard](https://dashboard.razorpay.com)
2. Toggle to **Test Mode** (top-left switch)
3. Go to **Settings → API Keys → Generate Key**
4. You'll get:
   - `rzp_test_xxxxx` — Key ID
   - A secret — Key Secret (shown once, save it)

Update `.env.local`:
```
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_xxxxx
RAZORPAY_SECRET=your_test_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_xxxxx
```

**Test keys start with `rzp_test_`, live keys with `rzp_live_`.** They access completely separate environments — test data is invisible in live mode and vice versa.

## Step 2: Create Test Plans

Plans must exist before you can create subscriptions. Create them in test mode:

```bash
curl -u rzp_test_xxxxx:your_test_secret \
  https://api.razorpay.com/v1/plans \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "period": "monthly",
    "interval": 1,
    "item": {
      "name": "Pro Plan Monthly",
      "amount": 99900,
      "currency": "INR",
      "description": "Pro plan billed monthly"
    }
  }'
```

Save the returned `plan_id` (e.g., `plan_test_xxxxx`) in your `.env.local`:
```
RAZORPAY_PLAN_MONTHLY=plan_test_xxxxx
```

**Test and live plans have different IDs.** You need separate plan IDs per environment.

## Step 3: Set Up ngrok for Webhooks

Razorpay can't reach `localhost`. You need a public tunnel.

### Install ngrok
```bash
# macOS
brew install ngrok

# or download from https://ngrok.com/download
# Sign up for free account and add authtoken
ngrok config add-authtoken your_token
```

### Start the tunnel
```bash
# Start your app first
npm run dev   # localhost:3000

# In another terminal, start ngrok
ngrok http 3000
```

ngrok gives you a URL like `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`. This is your public URL.

**Keep ngrok running** throughout your testing session. If you restart ngrok, you get a new URL and must re-register the webhook.

### Free tier limitation
ngrok free tier gives a random URL each time. Paid plans give a stable subdomain. For development, random is fine — just update the webhook URL each session.

> Razorpay's own validate-test guide now demos `zrok` as the tunnel, but ngrok still works fine — use either.

## Step 4: Register Webhook in Razorpay

1. Go to **Razorpay Dashboard → Account & Settings → Webhooks** (in test mode)
2. Click **Add New Webhook**
3. Set the URL: `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/api/webhooks/razorpay`
4. Set a webhook secret (any strong string) — save it as `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env.local`
5. Select events to listen for:
   - `subscription.authenticated`
   - `subscription.activated`
   - `subscription.charged`
   - `subscription.cancelled`
   - `subscription.completed`
   - `subscription.halted`
   - `subscription.paused`
   - `subscription.resumed`
   - `subscription.pending`
   - `subscription.updated`
   - `payment.authorized`
   - `payment.failed`
   - `refund.created` (if using refunds)
   - `refund.processed`
   - `refund.failed`
   - `refund.speed_changed`
6. Click **Create Webhook**

**Webhook secret is NOT the same as API secret.** They're separate values.

## Step 5: End-to-End Test Flow

### Test a subscription

1. Start your app and ngrok
2. Click your subscribe button — it should create a subscription and open `short_url`
3. On the Razorpay checkout page, use test card details (see below)
4. After payment, check:
   - **Your terminal**: webhook logs should show incoming events
   - **ngrok inspector** at `http://127.0.0.1:4040`: shows all requests with payloads
   - **Razorpay Dashboard → Webhooks**: shows delivery attempts and response codes
   - **Your database**: subscription should be `active`

### Test card numbers

Domestic success cards:

| Card | Number | Behavior |
|------|--------|----------|
| Success (Visa) | `4100 2800 0000 1007` | Payment succeeds |
| Success (Mastercard) | `5500 6700 0000 1002` | Payment succeeds |
| Success (RuPay) | `6527 6589 0000 1005` | Payment succeeds |

Failure / error cards (each forces a specific decline reason):

| Card | Number | Error |
|------|--------|-------|
| Card declined | `4100 2800 0006 0003` | `card_declined` |
| Insufficient funds | `4100 2800 0008 0001` | `insufficient_fund` |
| Payment timed out | `4100 2800 0009 0000` | `payment_timed_out` |
| Authentication failed | `4100 2800 0000 0009` | `authentication_failed` |

- **Expiry**: Any future date (e.g., `12/35`)
- **CVV**: Any 3 digits (e.g., `123`)
- **Name**: Anything
- **OTP/3DS**: No fixed OTP — any OTP of 4–10 digits succeeds; fewer than 4 digits fails.

### Test UPI
Use any valid format UPI ID like `success@razorpay` for successful payments, or `failure@razorpay` to test the failure path.

### Test a refund

```bash
# After a successful test payment, get the payment ID from your DB or dashboard
curl -u rzp_test_xxxxx:your_test_secret \
  https://api.razorpay.com/v1/payments/pay_xxxxx/refund \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "amount": 99900 }'
```

Test mode refunds are typically immediate (not contractually documented). Live mode takes 5-7 business days.

## Step 6: Inspect Webhook Payloads

### ngrok web inspector
Open `http://127.0.0.1:4040` in your browser. You can:
- See every request Razorpay sends
- Inspect headers (including `x-razorpay-signature` and `x-razorpay-event-id`)
- View the full JSON payload
- **Replay requests** — click "Replay" to re-send a webhook for debugging

### Manual webhook testing with curl

Generate a test signature:
```bash
# Replace with your actual webhook secret and payload
export WEBHOOK_SECRET="your_webhook_secret"
export PAYLOAD='{"event":"subscription.activated","payload":{"subscription":{"entity":{"id":"sub_test123","plan_id":"plan_test456","status":"active","notes":{"userId":"user_1","planKey":"pro_monthly"}}}}}'

# Generate signature
SIGNATURE=$(echo -n "$PAYLOAD" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$WEBHOOK_SECRET" | awk '{print $NF}')

# Send test webhook
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/razorpay \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-razorpay-event-id: evt_test_$(date +%s)" \
  -H "x-razorpay-signature: $SIGNATURE" \
  -d "$PAYLOAD"
```

Expected responses:
- `200 OK` — webhook processed successfully
- `400 Missing signature` — signature header missing
- `400 Invalid signature` — wrong secret or payload mismatch

## Step 7: Going to Production Checklist

Before switching from test to live:

- [ ] Generate **live** API keys from Razorpay Dashboard (production mode)
- [ ] Create **live** plans (plan IDs are different from test)
- [ ] Register webhook with your **production URL** (not ngrok)
- [ ] Set **live** webhook secret
- [ ] Update all env vars (`rzp_test_` → `rzp_live_`, plan IDs, webhook secret)
- [ ] Verify webhook endpoint is HTTPS (required for live)
- [ ] Test with a real Rs 1 payment to confirm the full flow
- [ ] Enable all needed webhook events in live webhook settings
- [ ] Remove any test-mode skips or debug logging from production code

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook not arriving
1. Check ngrok is running and URL matches webhook registration
2. Check ngrok inspector (`http://127.0.0.1:4040`) for incoming requests
3. Check Razorpay Dashboard → Webhooks → delivery attempts
4. Verify you're in **test mode** on the dashboard (not live)

### Signature verification failing
1. Check you're using `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, not `RAZORPAY_SECRET`
2. Check you're reading raw body with `request.text()`, not `request.json()`
3. Check the secret matches what you set in Razorpay Dashboard

### ngrok URL changed
If ngrok restarted, update the webhook URL in Razorpay Dashboard. Old URL won't work.

### Payment stuck in "created"
User didn't complete checkout. In test mode, go to the `short_url` and complete payment with test card.

### Webhook returns 500
Check your app logs. Common causes:
- Database not running or not migrated
- Missing env vars
- Auth middleware blocking the webhook endpoint (webhooks are unauthenticated — exempt this route)
